# Welcome to Food Carti!

## We seek to extend the capabilities of Beli to local food carts!
- In our main screen, we have a feed of reviews which include a score, optional description, and user. You can click on the reviews or add your own!
- In our map screen, we have a map of the different locations, including the user's current location. When you click on each location, you can check out its details and then add a review. Additionally, you can save food carts you love!
- In our user screen, you can see your username (which persists), which you entered when first signing in, then any locations you favorited (which persist).

## Main Concepts
- User Location
- Persistent Storage
- MapKit
